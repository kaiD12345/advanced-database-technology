
This project is about tracking how drinks move from the factory to the market.  
It helps follow up on production, deliveries, sales, and payments.

Main parts of the system:

1. Products : Different types of drinks like juice, soda, and water.
2. Batches : Groups of drinks made on the same day.
3. Distributors: Companies that take drinks to different regions.
4. Deliveries : Records of which batch was sent to which distributor.
5. Invoices : Bills sent to distributors for each delivery.
6. Payments : Money received from distributors.

Key features:

- Each table has a unique ID to keep things organized.
- Connections between tables help link products to sales.
- Rules are added to make sure data is correct (like prices must be positive).
- If an invoice is deleted, its payments are also removed automatically.
- The system can show total sales per region and per product.
- It can also show which distributors still owe money.
- A special rule marks expired batches based on their expiry date.

This database helps the factory know:
- What was made
- Where it was sent
- How much was sold
- Who paid and who didn’t

It’s useful for managing stock, tracking money, and making business decisions.
