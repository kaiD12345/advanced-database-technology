

Overview:
This project shows how smart systems can help manage health and safety information. 
It includes examples of how to keep medicine records safe, how bills can update themselves,
 how people report to supervisors, and how diseases are linked together. 
It also shows how to find nearby clinics using location data.

Main Sections:
1. Safe Prescriptions:
   - The system checks if medicine details are correct.
   - It blocks unsafe doses or wrong dates.

2. Automatic Bill Updates:
   - When items are added, changed, or removed, the total bill updates itself.
   - This helps avoid mistakes and keeps records clean.

3. Supervision Chain:
   - Shows how staff members are connected through reporting lines.
   - Helps trace who supervises whom, even in long chains.

4. Disease Knowledge:
   - Uses simple facts to link patients to diseases.
   - Helps group diseases by type (like viral or chronic).

5. Clinic Locator:
   - Finds clinics near a given location.
   - Helps ambulances or patients reach help faster.

How to Use:
- Each part includes examples you can try.
- The system gives feedback when something is wrong.
- You can search, insert, and view data to learn how it works.

Purpose:
This project helps students understand how smart databases can support health systems. 
It connects rules, relationships, and real-world needs in a simple and useful way.
